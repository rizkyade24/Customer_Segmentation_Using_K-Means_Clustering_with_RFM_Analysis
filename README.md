For Customer Segmentation on the Online Retail Dataset. We will know each customer segmentation’s characteristics using RFM Analysis

**Background: Why is Customer Segmentation Important?**
Customer segmentation describes the process of identifying groups or segments of a company’s customers who have similar characteristics or factors.

The goal of this segmentation is to optimize marketing for each segment. Customer segmentation is important and vital for

1. Optimizing marketing strategies,
2. Maximizing customer value to the business, and
3. Improving customer satisfaction and experience.

Grouping customers and prospects into customer segments with similar characteristics will help businesses to identify their target customer base. That way, a business’s marketing strategies can be effective and appropriate (not offensive, efficient, and relevant). So knowing customer segmentation will not only save time and money but will enhance the benefits as well.

The graph below shows the explanation and correlation between RFM with class/segments. As an example, class 2 has not most visiting recently, but they have the highest total purchase for the transaction and often come to retail, we can call it a loyal customer.
